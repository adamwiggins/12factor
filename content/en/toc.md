The Twelve Factors
==================

## [I. Codebase](./codebase)
### One codebase tracked in revision control, many deploys

## [II. Dependencies](./dependencies)
### Explicitly declare and isolate dependencies

## [III. Config](./config)
### Store config in the environment

## [IV. Backing Services](./backing-services)

## [V. Build, release, run](./build-release-run)
### Strictly separate build and run stages

## [VI. Processes](./processes)
### Execute the app as one or more stateless processes

## [VII. Port binding](./port-binding)
### Export services via port binding

## [VIII. Concurrency](./concurrency)
### Scale out via the process model

## [IX. Disposability](./disposability)
### Maximize robustness with fast startup and graceful shutdown

## [X. Dev/prod parity](./dev-prod-parity)
### Keep development, staging, and production as similar as possible

## [XI. Logs](./logs)
### Treat logs as event streams

## [XII. Admin processes](./admin-processes)
### Run admin/management tasks as one-off processes
